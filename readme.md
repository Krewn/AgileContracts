Hi,

I found myself in need of lightweight easy to understand expand agile development contracts.
I read through a couple software contracts and came up with these.

Feel free to contact me with proposals, spec sheets, or issues here on the Contracts repo.

Note:: As of now these contracts do not address TOS. I will be writing some TOS soon so keep
an eye out for that.
